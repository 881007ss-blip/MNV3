## ðŸ“˜ Overview
MNV3-GRU is a deep learning framework designed to leverage continuous image signals for action recognition, enabling real-time drone control.  
The system utilizes a hybrid architecture combining **MobileNetV3** and **GRU** to enhance its understanding of temporal and spatial signals.

It supports:

- **Model training and testing**  
- **Real-time inference on a PC**
